**Interesting musings** I found off of reddit. This is the general consensus of how the Black Mirror universe slowly unfolds.

**Debating if future posts about Black Mirror will be separate or just included in this post as a compendium of sorts**

I first heard of Black Mirror around 2015~?

I was told you can start anywhere because it was not a standard show and each episode was more of a mini-movie with its own universe?

Black Mirror is a show that I finally started and very quickly led to a fuelled obession to finish the series in one sitting. I did not accomplish such a feat as there are currently 13 episodes released and each episode is in the 50 minute mark. A marathon would take 650 minutes or almost 10 minutes short from 11 hours to complete.

Nonetheless, if I had to describe Black Mirror as a recommendation in just a sentence - A clever display of mocking current geopolitical events, the values and beliefs of mankind, and impact of morality as we continue to shape the planet we live on into a dystopian nightmare referenced in a certain literature; 1984.

Each episode has its own quirks and mockery. The continuity is what makes this show stand out from the rest. Some people call it easter eggs or spoofs but I want to call it carefully planned out continuity. The cast is not reoccurring. But any careful viewer can quickly deduct the technologies introduced share the same core concepts. The analogy here would be watching the Wright Brothers develop the first man-made airplane in one episode and the next episode showcases the fastest fighter jets of the 21st century.

One reoccuring technology is augmentation of the eyes. Black Mirror delves into this concept spanning 3 episodes to cover the military use, commerical use, and consumer use.
