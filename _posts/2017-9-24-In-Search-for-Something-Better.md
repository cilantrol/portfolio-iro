My current age at the time of this post is approximately 1 month after reaching 25. Many people say this is the quarter life crisis moment, but that's assuming I'll live to 100. To understand who I am, I must trace back to my origin.

My family comes from China and they immigrated to America in the mid-80s. My parents grew up in Mao's China. My mother comes from the city where she enjoyed necessities. She would tell me stories when I was young about how chicken eggs were so valuable as a commodity, it could be considered currency. My father on the other hand grew up in the country side and was forced leave school and farm by the age of 11.

The minimum wage some 30 odd years ago was less than four dollars and one could buy a house with 50 thousand saved up. I was born in an extreme poverty line where I was living with 8 other people in the household. My parents worked hard to put food on the table so I spent the majority of my toddler years alone. My choice of pastimes were Legos and drawing. My father worked as an artist in China before immigrating. He was self-taught and I watched him paint throughout my childhood on the rare occasions he was not working his blue-collar job.

Perhaps this is what sparked my interest or obsessive-compulsive disorder in aesthetics. If things were not perfectly uniform or straight, I would spend hours trying to re-align objects to best of my vision.

_Education_

I did not learn English until the age of 6 despite born as an US Citizen. I was in ESL until 3rd grade and I went to tutoring centers to improve my academics during the weekend. Conveying thoughts in a concise, articulate, and non-passive voice has always been an opportunity area for me mainly due to never learning proper grammar. I wasn't much of a reader as  well.

I went to college and took my first computer programming course. It was an introductory course to C++. I took the course as a recommendation from a friend that told me it was "free". It was a poor decision because I was also learning accounting and calculus during that same semester. My programming course was delegated to the lowest priority.

I finished that course with a bitter sweet taste. I knew I could have learned so much more...

_Work_

Flash forward a few years and I found myself with a diploma. I studied managerial economics with the mindset to go into finance or consulting. I did neither and found myself in the hospitality industry. At the point in my life I didn't really care exactly what I did as long as it paid well.

I realized I spoke too soon when a year went by really fast and I had this feeling of emptiness. I worked on average 50 hours a week doing something I had no passion for. I soon found myself working through the motions and I would try to socialize as much as possible to try to hide the fact I was numb.

I left my job after working there for exactly 2 years. It didnt take long for me to realize I was tunnel visioned. I spent 2 years not being able to solve the problems I declared I was going to solve on the first day. So I asked myself, what happened? Did I simply did not care enough or was I incompetent? I figured out that it was the passion I lacked and I was numb to my surroundings.

_2017 and onwards..._

It wasn't long before I found another job but this time I chose not to work full-time. My goal was to either go back to school or start in a few field.

I always had interest in web development but I thought it was too hard when I was in my teens. One of my values include finishing what you start. I wanted to finally give myself the time to learn programming the right way. Even if I don't succeed, at least I have no regrets and knew I tried my best.
